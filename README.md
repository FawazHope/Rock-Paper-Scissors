# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is a mini project i created based on the childhood game rock paper scissors. Hopefully you stand a better chance than me at beating the computer.
The game is very simple, You have a pick from the three usual options i.e rock/paper/scissors and in turn the computer has a set response on whatever option it has picked also.
After youre done with the game and you want to stop playing you can press the letter Q which will then stop the game.
